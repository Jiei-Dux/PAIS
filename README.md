My Post.Archlinux.Installation.Script <br>
because I am too lazy to type all the fucking commands <br>
every after clean installation <br>

===========================================================================

PS: This script is only has the shit that I install <br>
every time I do a clean install so, if you are ever <br>
interested in this script and wanted to use it, then <br>
I advice you to change all the packages inside, or <br>
keep it as it is, your choice, I only uploaded this <br>
shit on github so I have a backup of it.
